In your project, the bus glides away using this code:

```

When does the bus glide away?

The code blocks run in order, look at the blocks before the `glide`{:class="block3motion"} block.

Yes. After you click on the green flag, there is a four-second wait before the bus glides away.

The bus does not have any code that runs `when this sprite clicked`{:class="block3events"}.

The bus takes two seconds to glide away, but that is not how long it waits before it moves.
