## Missing the bus

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">
What if the Scratch Cat did not run fast enough to catch the bus?

--- task ---

Select the **Scratch Cat** sprite and add a `wait`{:class="block3control"} block:

![The Scratch Cat sprite.](images/scratch-cat-sprite.png)

```blocks3
when flag clicked
go to x:(200) y:(-150) 
show
repeat (20) // try different numbers
move (5) steps 
next costume 
+ wait (1) seconds
end
hide
```
--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Test:** Click on the green flag. The Scratch Cat will walk too slowly and miss the bus!

--- /task ---

You will want delays of less than one second. 0.5 is half a second, 0.25 is a quarter of a second, and 0.1 is a tenth of a second.

--- task ---

Change the delay in the `wait`{:class="block3control"} block:

![The Scratch Cat sprite.](images/scratch-cat-sprite.png)

```blocks3
wait (0.2) seconds // try 0.1, 0.5, 0.05
```

**Test:** Click on the green flag, and the Scratch Cat will walk faster. Choose the delay that you like the most.

--- /task ---

**Choose:** Choose if you want the Scratch Cat to **miss the bus** or **catch the bus**.

--- task ---

If you want the Scratch Cat to **miss the bus**, remove the `hide`{:class="block3looks"} block from your code so that the Scratch Cat stays on the Stage:

![Dragging the 'hide' block from the script in the Code area to the Blocks menu to remove the block from the script.](images/removing-blocks-at-script-ends.gif)

![The Scratch Cat sprite.](images/scratch-cat-sprite.png)

```blocks3
when flag clicked
go to x:(200) y:(-150) 
show
repeat (20) 
move (5) steps 
next costume
wait (0.5) seconds 
end
-hide
```
--- /task ---

--- task ---

If you want the Scratch Cat to **catch the bus**, make the bus wait longer before it leaves:

![The City Bus sprite.](images/bus-sprite.png)

```blocks3
+when [timer v] > [6] // change from 4 to 6
glide [2] secs to x: [320] y: [-100] // right-hand side of the Stage
hide
```

You will need to put the `hide`{:class="block3looks"} block back in the **Scratch Cat** sprite's code if you have removed it and want the Scratch Cat to successfully catch the bus.

Make changes until you get the animation to work the way that you want it to.

When working on a project, you often go back and change or improve your code as you get new ideas.
