```blocks3

repeat (5)
move (5) steps

Yes! The `repeat`{:class="block3control"} code block uses a loop to make the dog run.

This code makes the dog move, but only once. There is no loop here, so the code does not repeat.

This code makes the dog run, but it does not use a loop. Using a loop can often make your code shorter.

There is no loop here, so the dog would only move once. To make the dog run, you would have to add a loop.
