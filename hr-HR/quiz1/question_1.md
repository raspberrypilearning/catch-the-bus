In your project, the bus glides away using this code:

```blocks3
when flag clicked 
wait [4] seconds
glide [2] secs to x: [320] y: [-100]
```

When does the bus glide away?

--- choices ---

- ( ) Immediately when you click on the green flag

  --- feedback ---

The code blocks run in order, look at the blocks before the `glide`{:class="block3motion"} block.

  --- /feedback ---

- (x) Four seconds after you click on the green flag

  --- feedback ---

Da. After you click on the green flag, there is a four-second wait before the bus glides away.

  --- /feedback ---

- () When you click on the bus

  --- feedback ---

The bus does not have any code that runs `when this sprite clicked`{:class="block3events"}.

  --- /feedback ---

- ( ) Two seconds after you click on the green flag

  --- feedback ---

The bus takes two seconds to glide away, but that is not how long it waits before it moves.
