## Missing the bus

To change the speed of the costume changes you can add a wait inside the movement loops for the cat or hippo.
You will want delays of less that one second. 0.5 is half a second. 0.25 is a quarter of a second and 0.1 is a tenth of a second. 
Try changing the numbers to get the animation effect you want. 
Try changing the number of steps the sprite moves each time and the number of times the loop repeats.
