- ( ) 
```blocks3
when flag clicked 
next costume
move (5) steps
```

There is no loop here and so the dog would not run. To make the dog run you would have to add a loop.

```blocks3
next costume
move (5) steps
next costume
move (5) steps
next costume
move (5) steps
next costume
move (5) steps
next costume
move (5) steps
```

This code makes the dog run, but it does not use a loop. It is always better to use a loop in programming when you can.
